    <h1>Training Simple Machine Learning
        Algorithms for Classification</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will make use of two of the first algorithmically described machine learning algorithms for classification: the perceptron and adaptive linear neurons. We will start by implementing a
    perceptron step by step in Python and training it to classify different flower species in the Iris dataset.
    This will help us to understand the concept of machine learning algorithms for classification and how
    they can be efficiently implemented in Python.</p>
<p>Discussing the basics of optimization using adaptive linear neurons will then lay the groundwork for
    using more sophisticated classifiers via the scikit-learn machine learning library in Chapter 3, A Tour
    of Machine Learning Classifiers Using Scikit-Learn.</p>
<p>The topics that we will cover in this chapter are as follows:</p>
<p>• Building an understanding of machine learning algorithms</p>
<p>• Using pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to read in, process, and visualize data</p>
<p>•Implementing linear classifiers for 2-class problems in Python</p>

    <h1>Artificial neurons - a brief glimpse into the early history
        of machine learning</h1>
<p>Before we discuss the perceptron and related algorithms in more detail, let's take a brief tour of the
    beginnings of machine learning. Trying to understand how the biological brain works in order to design an artificial intelligence (AI), Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts published the first concept of
    a simplified brain cell, the so-called McCulloch-Pitts (MCP) neuron, in 1943 (A Logical Calculus of the
    Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity by W. S. McCulloch and W. Pitts, Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics,
    5(4): 115-133, 1943).</p><hr>

<p>Biological neurons are interconnected nerve cells in the brain that are involved in the processing and
    transmitting of chemical and electrical signals, which is illustrated in Figure 2.1:</p>
<p>McCulloch and Pitts described such a nerve cell as a simple logic gate with binary outputs; multiple
    signals arrive at the dendrites, they are then integrated into the cell body, and, if the accumulated
    signal exceeds a certain threshold, an output signal is generated that will be passed on by the axon.</p>
<p>Only a few years later, Frank Rosenblatt published the first concept of the perceptron learning rule
    based on the MCP neuron model (The Perceptron: A Perceiving and Recognizing Automaton by F. Rosenblatt,
    Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, 1957). With his perceptron rule, Rosenblatt proposed an algorithm
    that would automatically learn the optimal weight coefficients that would then be multiplied with the
    input features in order to make the decision of whether a neuron fires (transmits a signal) or not. In
    the context of supervised learning and classification, such an algorithm could then be used to predict
    whether a new data point belongs to one class or the other.</p>

    <h1>The formal definition of an artificial neuron</h1>
<p>More formally, we can put the idea behind artificial neurons into the context of a binary classification task with two classes: 0 and 1. We can then define a decision function, 𝜎𝜎𝜎𝜎𝜎𝜎, that takes a linear
    combination of certain input values, x, and a corresponding weight vector, w, where z is the so-called
    net input z = w1x1 + w2x2 + ... + wmxm:</p>
<p>Now, if the net input of a particular example, x(i), is greater than a defined threshold, 𝜃𝜃, we predict
    class 1, and class 0 otherwise. In the perceptron algorithm, the decision function, 𝜎𝜎(∙), is a variant of
    a unit step function:</p><hr>


<!-- หน้า 21 -->
-- หน้า 21 --


<p>To simplify the code implementation later, we can modify this setup via a couple of steps. First, we
    move the threshold, 𝜃𝜃, to the left side of the equation:</p>
<p>Second, we define a so-called bias unit as b = -0 and make it part of the net input:</p>
<p>Third, given the introduction of the bias unit and the redefinition of the net input z above, we can
    redefine the decision function as follows:</p>
<p>Linear algebra basics: dot product and matrix transpose</p>
<p>In the following sections, we will often make use of basic notations from linear algebra.
    For example, we will abbreviate the sum of the products of the values in x and w using a
    vector dot product, whereas the superscript T stands for transpose, which is an operation
    that transforms a column vector into a row vector and vice versa. For example, assume
    we have the following two column vectors:</p>
<p>Then, we can write the transpose of vector a as aT = [a1 a2 a3] and write the dot product as</p>
<p>Furthermore, the transpose operation can also be applied to matrices to reflect it over its
    diagonal, for example:</p>
<p>Please note that the transpose operation is strictly only defined for matrices; however,
    in the context of machine learning, we refer to n × 1 or 1 × m matrices when we use the
    term “vector.”</p>
<p>In this book, we will only use very basic concepts from linear algebra; however, if you
    need a quick refresher, please take a look at Zico Kolter’s excellent Linear Algebra Review
    and Reference, which is freely available at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zkolter/course/
    linalg/linalg_notes.pdf.</p><hr>

<p>Figure 2.2 illustrates how the net input z = wTx + b is squashed into a binary output (0 or 1) by the
decision function of the perceptron (left subfigure) and how it can be used to discriminate between
two classes separable by a linear decision boundary (right subfigure):</p>

<h1>The perceptron learning rule</h1>
<p>The whole idea behind the MCP neuron and Rosenblatt’s thresholded perceptron model is to use a reductionist approach to mimic how a single neuron in the brain works: it either fires or it doesn’t. Thus,
    Rosenblatt’s classic perceptron rule is fairly simple, and the perceptron algorithm can be summarized
    by the following steps:</p>
<p>1. Initialize the weights and bias unit to 0 or small random numbers</p>
<p>2. For each training example, x(i):</p>
<p>a. Compute the output value, y(i)</p>
<p>b. Update the weights and bias unit</p>
<p>Here, the output value is the class label predicted by the unit step function that we defined earlier, and
    the simultaneous update of the bias unit and each weight, wj, in the weight vector, w, can be more
    formally written as:</p>
<p>The update values (“deltas”) are computed as follows:</p><hr>


<!-- หน้า 23 -->
-- หน้า 23 --


<p>Note that unlike the bias unit, each weight, wj, corresponds to a feature, xj, in the dataset, which is
    involved in determining the update value, Δ𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗, defined above. Furthermore, 𝜂𝜂 is the learning rate
    (typically a constant between 0.0 and 1.0), y(i) is the true class label of the ith training example, and
    𝑦𝑦𝑦(𝑖𝑖) is the predicted class label. It is important to note that the bias unit and all weights in the weight
    vector are being updated simultaneously, which means that we don’t recompute the predicted label,
    𝑦𝑦𝑦(𝑖𝑖), before the bias unit and all of the weights are updated via the respective update values, Δ𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 and
    Δ𝑏𝑏. Concretely, for a two-dimensional dataset, we would write the update as:</p>
<p>Before we implement the perceptron rule in Python, let’s go through a simple thought experiment to
    illustrate how beautifully simple this learning rule really is. In the two scenarios where the perceptron predicts the class label correctly, the bias unit and weights remain unchanged, since the update
    values are 0:</p>>
<p>However, in the case of a wrong prediction, the weights are being pushed toward the direction of the
    positive or negative target class:</p>
<p>To get a better understanding of the feature value as a multiplicative factor, 𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗(𝑖𝑖), let’s go through another simple example, where:</p>
<p>Let’s assume that xj(i) = 1.5 and we misclassify this example as class 0. In this case, we would increase
    the corresponding weight by 2.5 in total so that the net input, 𝑧𝑧 𝑧 𝑧𝑧𝑗𝑗(𝑖𝑖) × 𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 + 𝑏𝑏, would be more positive
    the next time we encounter this example, and thus be more likely to be above the threshold of the
    unit step function to classify the example as class 1:</p>
<p>The weight update, ∆𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗, is proportional to the value of 𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗(𝑖𝑖). For instance, if we have another example,
    xj(𝑖) = 2, that is incorrectly classified as class 0, we will push the decision boundary by an even larger
    extent to classify this example correctly the next time:</p><hr>

<p>It is important to note that the convergence of the perceptron is only guaranteed if the two classes
are linearly separable, which means that the two classes cannot be perfectly separated by a linear
decision boundary. (Interested readers can find the convergence proof in my lecture notes: https://
sebastianraschka.com/pdf/lecture-notes/stat453ss21/L03_perceptron_slides.pdf). Figure 2.3
shows visual examples of linearly separable and linearly inseparable scenarios:</p>
<p>If the two classes can’t be separated by a linear decision boundary, we can set a maximum number
    of passes over the training dataset (epochs) and/or a threshold for the number of tolerated misclassifications—the perceptron would never stop updating the weights otherwise. Later in this chapter,
    we will cover the Adaline algorithm that produces linear decision boundaries and converges even if
    the classes are not perfectly linearly separable. In Chapter 3, we will learn about algorithms that can
    produce nonlinear decision boundaries.</p>
<p>Downloading the example code</p>

    from your account at http://www.packtpub.com. If you purchased this book elsewhere,
    you can download all code examples and datasets directly from https://github.com/
    rasbt/machine-learning-book.</p>
<p>Now, before we jump into the implementation in the next section, what you just learned can be summarized in a simple diagram that illustrates the general concept of the perceptron:</p><hr>


<!-- หน้า 25 -->
-- หน้า 25 --


<p>The preceding diagram illustrates how the perceptron receives the inputs of an example (x) and combines them with the bias unit (b) and weights (w) to compute the net input. The net input is then passed
    on to the threshold function, which generates a binary output of 0 or 1—the predicted class label of
    the example. During the learning phase, this output is used to calculate the error of the prediction
    and update the weights and bias unit.</p>

<h1>Implementing a perceptron learning algorithm in Python</h1>
<p>In the previous section, we learned how Rosenblatt’s perceptron rule works; let’s now implement it
    in Python and apply it to the Iris dataset that we introduced in Chapter 1, Giving Computers the Ability
    to Learn from Data.</p>
<h1>An object-oriented perceptron API</h1>
<p>We will take an object-oriented approach to defining the perceptron interface as a Python class, which
    will allow us to initialize new Perceptron objects that can learn from data via a fit method and make
    predictions via a separate predict method. As a convention, we append an underscore (_) to attributes
    that are not created upon the initialization of the object, but we do this by calling the object’s other
    methods, for example, self.w_.</p><hr>

<p>Additional resources for Python’s scientific computing stack
    If you are not yet familiar with Python’s scientific libraries or need a refresher, please see
    the following resources:</p>
<p>• NumPy: https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2020/numpy-intro.html</p>
<p>• pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_
    guide/10min.html</p>
<p>• Matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/
    usage.html</p>
<p>The following is the implementation of a perceptron in Python:</p><hr>



<!-- หน้า 28 -->
-- หน้า 28 --


<p>Using this perceptron implementation, we can now initialize new Perceptron objects with a given
    learning rate, eta (𝜂𝜂), and the number of epochs, n_iter (passes over the training dataset).</p>
<p>Via the fit method, we initialize the bias self.b_ to an initial value 0 and the weights in self.w_ to
    a vector, ℝ𝑚𝑚, where m stands for the number of dimensions (features) in the dataset.</p>
<p>Notice that the initial weight vector contains small random numbers drawn from a normal distribution
    with a standard deviation of 0.01 via rgen.normal(loc=0.0, scale=0.01, size=1 + X.shape[1]),
    where rgen is a NumPy random number generator that we seeded with a user-specified random seed
    so that we can reproduce previous results if desired.</p>
<p>Technically, we could initialize the weights to zero (in fact, this is done in the original perceptron algorithm). However, if we did that, then the learning rate 𝜂𝜂 (eta) would have no effect on the decision
    boundary. If all the weights are initialized to zero, the learning rate parameter, eta, affects only the
    scale of the weight vector, not the direction. If you are familiar with trigonometry, consider a vector,
    v1 =[1 2 3], where the angle between v1 and a vector, v2 = 0.5 × v1, would be exactly zero, as demonstrated by the following code snippet:</p>
<p>Here, np.arccos is the trigonometric inverse cosine, and np.linalg.norm is a function that computes
    the length of a vector. (Our decision to draw the random numbers from a random normal distribution—for example, instead of from a uniform distribution—and to use a standard deviation of 0.01
    was arbitrary; remember, we are just interested in small random values to avoid the properties of
    all-zero vectors, as discussed earlier.)</p>
<p>As an optional exercise after reading this chapter, you can change self.w_ = rgen.normal(loc=0.0,
    scale=0.01, size=X.shape[1]) to self.w_ = np.zeros(X.shape[1]) and run the perceptron training code presented in the next section with different values for eta. You will observe that the decision
    boundary does not change.</p>
<p>NumPy array indexing</p>
<p>NumPy indexing for one-dimensional arrays works similarly to Python lists using the
    square-bracket ([]) notation. For two-dimensional arrays, the first indexer refers to the
    row number and the second indexer to the column number. For example, we would use
    X[2, 3] to select the third row and fourth column of a two-dimensional array, X.</p><hr>

-- หน้า 29 --


<p>After the weights have been initialized, the fit method loops over all individual examples in the
    training dataset and updates the weights according to the perceptron learning rule that we discussed
    in the previous section.</p>
<p> The class labels are predicted by the predict method, which is called in the fit method during
    training to get the class label for the weight update; but predict can also be used to predict the class
    labels of new data after we have fitted our model. Furthermore, we also collect the number of misclassifications during each epoch in the self.errors_ list so that we can later analyze how well our
    perceptron performed during the training. The np.dot function that is used in the net_input method
    simply calculates the vector dot product, wTx + b.</p>
    
<p>Vectorization: Replacing for loops with vectorized code</p>
<p>Instead of using NumPy to calculate the vector dot product between two arrays, a and b,
    via a.dot(b) or np.dot(a, b), we could also perform the calculation in pure Python
    via sum([i * j for i, j in zip(a, b)]). However, the advantage of using NumPy
    over classic Python for loop structures is that its arithmetic operations are vectorized.
    Vectorization means that an elemental arithmetic operation is automatically applied to
    all elements in an array. By formulating our arithmetic operations as a sequence of instructions on an array, rather than performing a set of operations for each element at a
    time, we can make better use of our modern central processing unit (CPU) architectures
    with single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) support. Furthermore, NumPy uses highly
    optimized linear algebra libraries, such as Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) and
    Linear Algebra Package (LAPACK), that have been written in C or Fortran. Lastly, NumPy
    also allows us to write our code in a more compact and intuitive way using the basics of
    linear algebra, such as vector and matrix dot products.</p>
<p>Training a perceptron model on the Iris dataset
<p>To test our perceptron implementation, we will restrict the following analyses and examples in the
    remainder of this chapter to two feature variables (dimensions). Although the perceptron rule is not
    restricted to two dimensions, considering only two features, sepal length and petal length, will allow
    us to visualize the decision regions of the trained model in a scatterplot for learning purposes.</p>
<p>Note that we will also only consider two flower classes, setosa and versicolor, from the Iris dataset for
    practical reasons—remember, the perceptron is a binary classifier. However, the perceptron algorithm
    can be extended to multi-class classification—for example, the one-versus-all (OvA) technique.</p><hr>


<!-- หน้า 30 -->
-- หน้า 30 --


<p>The OvA method for multi-class classification</p>
<p>OvA, which is sometimes also called one-versus-rest (OvR), is a technique that allows us to
extend any binary classifier to multi-class problems. Using OvA, we can train one classifier
per class, where the particular class is treated as the positive class and the examples from
all other classes are considered negative classes. If we were to classify a new, unlabeled
data instance, we would use our n classifiers, where n is the number of class labels, and
assign the class label with the highest confidence to the particular instance we want to
classify. In the case of the perceptron, we would use OvA to choose the class label that is
associated with the largest absolute net input value.</p>
<p>First, we will use the pandas library to load the Iris dataset directly from the UCI Machine Learning
Repository into a DataFrame object and print the last five lines via the tail method to check that the
data was loaded correctly:</p>
<p>After executing the previous code, we should see the following output, which shows the last five lines
    of the Iris dataset:</p><hr>


<!-- หน้า 31 -->
-- หน้า 31 --


<P>Loading the Iris dataset</P>
<P>You can find a copy of the Iris dataset (and all other datasets used in this book) in the code
    bundle of this book, which you can use if you are working offline or if the UCI server at
    https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data
    is temporarily unavailable. For instance, to load the Iris dataset from a local directory,
    you can replace this line,</P>
<P>Next, we extract the first 100 class labels that correspond to the 50 Iris-setosa and 50 Iris-versicolor
    flowers and convert the class labels into the two integer class labels, 1 (versicolor) and 0 (setosa), that
    we assign to a vector, y, where the values method of a pandas DataFrame yields the corresponding
    NumPy representation.</P>
<P>Similarly, we extract the first feature column (sepal length) and the third feature column (petal length)
    of those 100 training examples and assign them to a feature matrix, X, which we can visualize via a
    two-dimensional scatterplot:</P><hr>


<!-- หน้า 32 -->
-- หน้า 32 --


<P>After executing the preceding code example, we should see the following scatterplot:</P>
<P>Figure 2.6 shows the distribution of flower examples in the Iris dataset along the two feature axes: petal
    length and sepal length (measured in centimeters). In this two-dimensional feature subspace, we can
    see that a linear decision boundary should be sufficient to separate setosa from versicolor flowers. Thus,
    a linear classifier such as the perceptron should be able to classify the flowers in this dataset perfectly</P>
<P>Now, it’s time to train our perceptron algorithm on the Iris data subset that we just extracted. Also,
    we will plot the misclassification error for each epoch to check whether the algorithm converged and
    found a decision boundary that separates the two Iris flower classes:</P>
<P>Note that the number of misclassification errors and the number of updates is the same, since the
    perceptron weights and bias are updated each time it misclassifies an example. After executing the
    preceding code, we should see the plot of the misclassification errors versus the number of epochs,
    as shown in Figure 2.7:</P><hr>


<!-- หน้า 33 -->
-- หน้า 33 --


<P>As we can see in Figure 2.7, our perceptron converged after the sixth epoch and should now be able
    to classify the training examples perfectly. Let’s implement a small convenience function to visualize
    the decision boundaries for two-dimensional datasets:</P><hr>


<!-- หน้า 34 -->
-- หน้า 34 --


<P>First, we define a number of colors and markers and create a colormap from the list of colors via
    ListedColormap. Then, we determine the minimum and maximum values for the two features and
    use those feature vectors to create a pair of grid arrays, xx1 and xx2, via the NumPy meshgrid function.
    Since we trained our perceptron classifier on two feature dimensions, we need to flatten the grid arrays
    and create a matrix that has the same number of columns as the Iris training subset so that we can
    use the predict method to predict the class labels, lab, of the corresponding grid points.</P>
<P>After reshaping the predicted class labels, lab, into a grid with the same dimensions as xx1 and xx2,
    we can now draw a contour plot via Matplotlib’s contourf function, which maps the different decision
    regions to different colors for each predicted class in the grid array:</P>
<P>After executing the preceding code example, we should now see a plot of the decision regions, as
    shown in Figure 2.8:</P><hr>


<!-- หน้า 35 -->
-- หน้า 35 --    


<P>As we can see in the plot, the perceptron learned a decision boundary that can classify all flower
    examples in the Iris training subset perfectly.</P>
<P>Perceptron convergence</P>
<P>Although the perceptron classified the two Iris flower classes perfectly, convergence is
    one of the biggest problems of the perceptron. Rosenblatt proved mathematically that
    the perceptron learning rule converges if the two classes can be separated by a linear hyperplane. However, if the classes cannot be separated perfectly by such a linear decision
    boundary, the weights will never stop updating unless we set a maximum number of epochs. Interested readers can find a summary of the proof in my lecture notes at https://
    sebastianraschka.com/pdf/lecture-notes/stat453ss21/L03_perceptron_slides.

<h1>Adaptive linear neurons and the convergence of learning</h1>
<P>In this section, we will take a look at another type of single-layer neural network (NN): ADAptive LInear
    NEuron (Adaline). Adaline was published by Bernard Widrow and his doctoral student Tedd Hoff only
    a few years after Rosenblatt’s perceptron algorithm, and it can be considered an improvement on the
    latter (An Adaptive “Adaline” Neuron Using Chemical “Memistors”, Technical Report Number 1553-2 by B.
    Widrow and colleagues, Stanford Electron Labs, Stanford, CA, October 1960).</P><hr>


<!-- หน้า 36 -->
-- หน้า 36 --


<P>The Adaline algorithm is particularly interesting because it illustrates the key concepts of defining and
    minimizing continuous loss functions. This lays the groundwork for understanding other machine
    learning algorithms for classification, such as logistic regression, support vector machines, and multilayer neural networks, as well as linear regression models, which we will discuss in future chapters.</P>
<P>The key difference between the Adaline rule (also known as the Widrow-Hoff rule) and Rosenblatt’s
    perceptron is that the weights are updated based on a linear activation function rather than a unit step
    function like in the perceptron. In Adaline, this linear activation function, 𝜎𝜎(𝑧𝑧), is simply the identity
    function of the net input, so that 𝜎(𝑧) = 𝑧.</P>
<P>While the linear activation function is used for learning the weights, we still use a threshold function
    to make the final prediction, which is similar to the unit step function that we covered earlier.</P>
<P>The main differences between the perceptron and Adaline algorithm are highlighted in Figure 2.9:</P><hr>


<!-- หน้า 37 -->
-- หน้า 37 --


<P>As Figure 2.9 indicates, the Adaline algorithm compares the true class labels with the linear activation
    function’s continuous valued output to compute the model error and update the weights. In contrast,
    the perceptron compares the true class labels to the predicted class labels.</P>
<h1>Minimizing loss functions with gradient descent</h1>
<P>One of the key ingredients of supervised machine learning algorithms is a defined objective function
    that is to be optimized during the learning process. This objective function is often a loss or cost function
    that we want to minimize. In the case of Adaline, we can define the loss function, L, to learn the model
    parameters as the mean squared error (MSE) between the calculated outcome and the true class label:</P>
<P>The term 1
    2
    is just added for our convenience and will make it easier to derive the gradient of the loss
    function with respect to the weight parameters, as we will see in the following paragraphs. The main
    advantage of this continuous linear activation function, in contrast to the unit step function, is that the
    loss function becomes differentiable. Another nice property of this loss function is that it is convex;
    thus, we can use a very simple yet powerful optimization algorithm called gradient descent to find
    the weights that minimize our loss function to classify the examples in the Iris dataset.</P>
<P>As illustrated in Figure 2.10, we can describe the main idea behind gradient descent as climbing down
    a hill until a local or global loss minimum is reached. In each iteration, we take a step in the opposite
    direction of the gradient, where the step size is determined by the value of the learning rate, as well as
    the slope of the gradient (for simplicity, the following figure visualizes this only for a single weight, w):</P>
<P>Using gradient descent, we can now update the model parameters by taking a step in the opposite
    direction of the gradient, ∇𝐿(w,b), of our loss function, L(w, b):</P><hr>


<!-- หน้า 38 -->
-- หน้า 38 --


<P>The parameter changes, Δ𝒘 and ∆𝑏, are defined as the negative gradient multiplied by the learning
    rate, 𝜂:</P>
<P>To compute the gradient of the loss function, we need to compute the partial derivative of the loss
    function with respect to each weight, wj:</P>
<P>Similarly, we compute the partial derivative of the loss with respect to the bias as:</P>
<P>Please note that the 2 in the numerator above is merely a constant scaling factor, and we could omit it
    without affecting the algorithm. Removing the scaling factor has the same effect as changing the learning rate by a factor of 2. The following information box explains where this scaling factor originates.
    So we can write the weight update as:</P>
<P>Since we update all parameters simultaneously, our Adaline learning rule becomes:</P>
<P>The mean squared error derivative</P>
<P>If you are familiar with calculus, the partial derivative of the MSE loss function with respect
    to the jth weight can be obtained as follows:</P><hr>


<!-- หน้า 39 -->
-- หน้า 39 --    


<P>Although the Adaline learning rule looks identical to the perceptron rule, we should note that 𝜎𝜎𝜎𝜎𝜎(𝑖𝑖))
    with 𝑧(𝑖) = 𝒘𝑇𝒙(i) + 𝑏 is a real number and not an integer class label. Furthermore, the weight update is calculated based on all examples in the training dataset (instead of updating the parameters
    incrementally after each training example), which is why this approach is also referred to as batch
    gradient descent. To be more explicit and avoid confusion when talking about related concepts later
    in this chapter and this book, we will refer to this process as full batch gradient descent.</P>

<h1>Implementing Adaline in Python</h1>
<P>Since the perceptron rule and Adaline are very similar, we will take the perceptron implementation
    that we defined earlier and change the fit method so that the weight and bias parameters are now
    updated by minimizing the loss function via gradient descent:</P><hr>


<!-- หน้า 41 -->
-- หน้า 41 --


<P>Instead of updating the weights after evaluating each individual training example, as in the perceptron,
    we calculate the gradient based on the whole training dataset. For the bias unit, this is done via self.
    eta * 2.0 * errors.mean(), where errors is an array containing the partial derivative values 𝜕/𝜕b.
    Similarly, we update the weights. However note that the weight updates via the partial derivatives 𝜕/𝜕w𝑗
    involve the feature values xj, which we can compute by multiplying errors with each feature value
    for each weight:</P>
<P>To implement the weight update more efficiently without using a for loop, we can use a matrix-vector
    multiplication between our feature matrix and the error vector instead:</P>
<P>Please note that the activation method has no effect on the code since it is simply an identity function. Here, we added the activation function (computed via the activation method) to illustrate the
    general concept with regard to how information flows through a single-layer NN: features from the
    input data, net input, activation, and output.</P>
<P>In the next chapter, we will learn about a logistic regression classifier that uses a non-identity, nonlinear activation function. We will see that a logistic regression model is closely related to Adaline, with
    the only difference being its activation and loss function.</P>
<P>Now, similar to the previous perceptron implementation, we collect the loss values in a self.losses_
    list to check whether the algorithm converged after training.</P>
<P>Matrix multiplication</P>
<P>Performing a matrix multiplication is similar to calculating a vector dot-product where
    each row in the matrix is treated as a single row vector. This vectorized approach represents
    a more compact notation and results in a more efficient computation using NumPy. For
    example:</P>
<P>Please note that in the preceding equation, we are multiplying a matrix with a vector,
    which is mathematically not defined. However, remember that we use the convention
    that this preceding vector is regarded as a 3x1 matrix.</P><hr>

<p>In practice, it often requires some experimentation to find a good learning rate, 𝜂𝜂, for optimal convergence. So, let’s choose two different learning rates, 𝜂𝜂 𝜂 𝜂𝜂𝜂 and 𝜂𝜂 𝜂 𝜂𝜂𝜂𝜂𝜂1, to start with and plot
    the loss functions versus the number of epochs to see how well the Adaline implementation learns
    from the training data.</p>
<p>Hyperparameters</p>
<p>The learning rate, 𝜂𝜂 (eta), as well as the number of epochs (n_iter), are the so-called hyperparameters (or tuning parameters) of the perceptron and Adaline learning algorithms.
    In Chapter 6, Learning Best Practices for Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning, we
    will take a look at different techniques to automatically find the values of different hyperparameters that yield optimal performance of the classification model.</p>
<p>Let’s now plot the loss against the number of epochs for the two different learning rates</p>
<p>As we can see in the resulting loss function plots, we encountered two different types of problems. The
    left chart shows what could happen if we choose a learning rate that is too large. Instead of minimizing
    the loss function, the MSE becomes larger in every epoch, because we overshoot the global minimum.
    On the other hand, we can see that the loss decreases on the right plot, but the chosen learning rate,
    𝜂 = 0.0001, is so small that the algorithm would require a very large number of epochs to converge
    to the global loss minimum:</p><hr>

<p>Figure 2.12 illustrates what might happen if we change the value of a particular weight parameter to
    minimize the loss function, L. The left subfigure illustrates the case of a well-chosen learning rate,
    where the loss decreases gradually, moving in the direction of the global minimum.</p>
<p>The subfigure on the right, however, illustrates what happens if we choose a learning rate that is too
    large—we overshoot the global minimum:</p>
<h1>Improving gradient descent through feature scaling</h1>
<p>Many machine learning algorithms that we will encounter throughout this book require some sort of
    feature scaling for optimal performance, which we will discuss in more detail in Chapter 3, A Tour of
    Machine Learning Classifiers Using Scikit-Learn, and Chapter 4, Building Good Training Datasets – Data
    Preprocessing.</p><hr>

<p>Gradient descent is one of the many algorithms that benefit from feature scaling. In this section, we
    will use a feature scaling method called standardization. This normalization procedure helps gradient
    descent learning to converge more quickly; however, it does not make the original dataset normally
    distributed. Standardization shifts the mean of each feature so that it is centered at zero and each feature
    has a standard deviation of 1 (unit variance). For instance, to standardize the jth feature, we can simply
    subtract the sample mean, 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗, from every training example and divide it by its standard deviation, 𝜎𝑗:</p>
<p>Here, xj is a vector consisting of the jth feature values of all training examples, n, and this standardization technique is applied to each feature, j, in our dataset.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why standardization helps with gradient descent learning is that it is easier to find a
    learning rate that works well for all weights (and the bias). If the features are on vastly different scales,
    a learning rate that works well for updating one weight might be too large or too small to update the
    other weight equally well. Overall, using standardized features can stabilize the training such that the
    optimizer has to go through fewer steps to find a good or optimal solution (the global loss minimum).
    Figure 2.13 illustrates possible gradient updates with unscaled features (left) and standardized features
    (right), where the concentric circles represent the loss surface as a function of two model weights in
    a two-dimensional classification problem:</p>
<p>Standardization can easily be achieved by using the built-in NumPy methods mean and std:</p>
<p>After standardization, we will train Adaline again and see that it now converges after a small number
    of epochs using a learning rate of 𝜂 = 0.5:</p><hr>

<p>After executing this code, we should see a figure of the decision regions, as well as a plot of the declining loss, as shown in Figure 2.14:</p>
<p>As we can see in the plots, Adaline has now converged after training on the standardized features.
    However, note that the MSE remains non-zero even though all flower examples were classified correctly</p>
<h1>Large-scale machine learning and stochastic gradient descent</h1>
<p>In the previous section, we learned how to minimize a loss function by taking a step in the opposite
    direction of the loss gradient that is calculated from the whole training dataset; this is why this approach
    is sometimes also referred to as full batch gradient descent. Now imagine that we have a very large
    dataset with millions of data points, which is not uncommon in many machine learning applications.
    Running full batch gradient descent can be computationally quite costly in such scenarios, since we
    need to reevaluate the whole training dataset each time we take one step toward the global minimum.</p><hr>

<p>A popular alternative to the batch gradient descent algorithm is stochastic gradient descent (SGD),
    which is sometimes also called iterative or online gradient descent. Instead of updating the weights
    based on the sum of the accumulated errors over all training examples, x(i):</p>
<p>we update the parameters incrementally for each training example, for instance:</p>
<p>Although SGD can be considered as an approximation of gradient descent, it typically reaches convergence much faster because of the more frequent weight updates. Since each gradient is calculated
    based on a single training example, the error surface is noisier than in gradient descent, which can
    also have the advantage that SGD can escape shallow local minima more readily if we are working
    with nonlinear loss functions, as we will see later in Chapter 11, Implementing a Multilayer Artificial
    Neural Network from Scratch. To obtain satisfying results via SGD, it is important to present training
    data in a random order; also, we want to shuffle the training dataset for every epoch to prevent cycles.</p>
<p>Adjusting the learning rate during training</p>
<p>In SGD implementations, the fixed learning rate, 𝜂, is often replaced by an adaptive learning
    rate that decreases over time, for example:</p>
<p>where c1 and c2 are constants. Note that SGD does not reach the global loss minimum
    but an area very close to it. And using an adaptive learning rate, we can achieve further
    annealing to the loss minimum.</p>
<p>Another advantage of SGD is that we can use it for online learning. In online learning, our model is
    trained on the fly as new training data arrives. This is especially useful if we are accumulating large
    amounts of data, for example, customer data in web applications. Using online learning, the system
    can immediately adapt to changes, and the training data can be discarded after updating the model
    if storage space is an issue.</p><hr>

<p>Mini-batch gradient descent</p>
<p>A compromise between full batch gradient descent and SGD is so-called mini-batch gradient descent. Mini-batch gradient descent can be understood as applying full batch gradient
    descent to smaller subsets of the training data, for example, 32 training examples at a
    time. The advantage over full batch gradient descent is that convergence is reached faster
    via mini-batches because of the more frequent weight updates. Furthermore, mini-batch
    learning allows us to replace the for loop over the training examples in SGD with vectorized operations leveraging concepts from linear algebra (for example, implementing a
    weighted sum via a dot product), which can further improve the computational efficiency
    of our learning algorithm.</p>
<p>Since we already implemented the Adaline learning rule using gradient descent, we only need to
    make a few adjustments to modify the learning algorithm to update the weights via SGD. Inside the
    fit method, we will now update the weights after each training example. Furthermore, we will implement an additional partial_fit method, which does not reinitialize the weights, for online learning.
    In order to check whether our algorithm converged after training, we will calculate the loss as the
    average loss of the training examples in each epoch. Furthermore, we will add an option to shuffle the
    training data before each epoch to avoid repetitive cycles when we are optimizing the loss function;
    via the random_state parameter, we allow the specification of a random seed for reproducibility:</p><hr>

<p>The _shuffle method that we are now using in the AdalineSGD classifier works as follows: via the
    permutation function in np.random, we generate a random sequence of unique numbers in the range
    0 to 100. Those numbers can then be used as indices to shuffle our feature matrix and class label vector</p>
<p>We can then use the fit method to train the AdalineSGD classifier and use our plot_decision_regions
    to plot our training results:</p><hr>


<!-- หน้า 51 -->
-- หน้า 51 --


<p>The two plots that we obtain from executing the preceding code example are shown in Figure 2.15:</p>
<p>As you can see, the average loss goes down pretty quickly, and the final decision boundary after 15 epochs looks similar to the batch gradient descent Adaline. If we want to update our model, for example,
    in an online learning scenario with streaming data, we could simply call the partial_fit method on
    individual training examples—for instance, ada_sgd.partial_fit(X_std[0, :], y[0])</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we gained a good understanding of the basic concepts of linear classifiers for supervised learning. After we implemented a perceptron, we saw how we can train adaptive linear neurons
    efficiently via a vectorized implementation of gradient descent and online learning via SGD.</p>
<p>Now that we have seen how to implement simple classifiers in Python, we are ready to move on to
    the next chapter, where we will use the Python scikit-learn machine learning library to get access to
    more advanced and powerful machine learning classifiers, which are commonly used in academia
    as well as in industry</p>
<p>The object-oriented approach that we used to implement the perceptron and Adaline algorithms will
    help with understanding the scikit-learn API, which is implemented based on the same core concepts
    that we used in this chapter: the fit and predict methods. Based on these core concepts, we will learn
    about logistic regression for modeling class probabilities and support vector machines for working with
    nonlinear decision boundaries. In addition, we will introduce a different class of supervised learning
    algorithms, tree-based algorithms, which are commonly combined into robust ensemble classifiers.</p><hr>
